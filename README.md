# Abstract

Medical image classification is crucial for improving diagnosis and treatment, especially when human analysis is time-consuming and less precise compared to Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Our study focused on classifying microscopic fungi images, addressing a significant yet frequently overlooked health threat posed by fungal infections. We evaluated the effectiveness of transfer learning using four pre-trained models (VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNetb0, and ViT16) using various metrics like balanced accuracy, MCC, F1-score, and confusion matrices. We also compared deep learning models with traditional machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest.  To ensure accurate model assessment, we implemented cross-validation for deep learning models to better assess their performance on unseen data. Notably, our findings reveal that EfficientNet outperformed all other models, achieving a remarkably balanced accuracy of 0.9 when augmented. Additionally, we employed GRAD-CAM for model explainability and visualized the Attention mechanism for VIT. These findings underscore the significant potential of deep learning models in medical image classification and their crucial role in addressing critical healthcare challenges.
